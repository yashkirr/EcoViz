# EcoViz
A software development project was undertaken with the overarching aim being to design a fully functional, high performance forest ecosystem visualisation application, necessary for displaying the comprising trees and shrubbery contained in formatted data files over a grey-scaled terrain. This visualisation application was equipped with an animated fire simulation and various filtering methods for ease of usage and viewing. The application also allowed for on-demand plant details retrieval with a simple click on the visualisation, where plants were symbolically displayed as colour-coded circles. Zoom and Drag functionality was also accounted for, allowing the user to zoom into and traverse portions of the visualisation, using both continuous and discrete zoom. A colour-to-species key was provided for further clarity to the user.
This application was designed for the primary stakeholder being the client, Dr James Gain, as well as the project tutor, Mr Nicholas Limbert. The use for this application was to aid in the visualisation of forest ecosystems, necessary for research in botany, thus making botanists and environmentalists, as well as the UCT Botany department, possible stakeholders as well.
